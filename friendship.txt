Elemental Friendship
Instrumental:
(Legend Of Everfree (Main Title)-Daniel Ingram)

Elements surround our world, for stories to unfold
Shining when summoned in Equestria, bright and bold
Us girls, we’ll stick together until the end
No villain, nopony else can make it bend

For peace and our elemental friendship
For peace and our elemental friendship

Rarity, Aj and Pinkie helping here on land
With magic, food and laughter and musical bands
Fluttershy and Rainbow helping out in the sky
Breezes, sunlight, winds all while you fly

For peace and our elemental friendship
For peace and our elemental friendship

For Laughter, thank you Pinkie Pie
Bringing smiles to ponies with your pies
Generosity, thanks Rarity
Gemstones, fashion dresses, beauty
And Kindness here, Fluttershy you're the best
Spreading your love, ponies and birds in their nests
Applejack you’re our Honesty element
Rainbow, Loyalty and dashing attempt

For peace and our elemental friendship
For peace and our elemental friendship
